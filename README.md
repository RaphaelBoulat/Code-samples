# Code-samples

This repo allows you to have an idea of my coding skills, both in R and STATA. 

Note that for the STATA code, I did not include the data set, since it was for a previous RA I have done and the project is still at an early stage. 

The R code reproduces column 2 of Table 3 in the paper (linear model decomposition with wealth). I included the initial dataset but the weights dataset is too big for Github.
